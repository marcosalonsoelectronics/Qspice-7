Files associated to video Qspice #7: Current-Mode Push-Pull Converter using the UC1846. Closed-Loop Design

Available at: https://youtu.be/jjh53uSWzdU

In this video we study the dynamic response of the current-mode push-pull converter and design a compensator for closed-loop operation. Everything is verified by Qspice simulations.
This is a continuation of previous video Qspice #6.
